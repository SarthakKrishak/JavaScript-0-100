Stack and Heap -->

The stack and heap are two fundamental data structures in computer science. The stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last item added to the stack is the
first one to be removed. The heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property

The heap property states that for any given node I, if I has children, then I is either
greater than (in a max heap) or less than (in a min heap) its children.

The heap is a complete binary tree, meaning that every level of the tree is fully filled, except for possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

The stack and heap are used in various algorithms and data structures, such as expression evaluation, recursive function calls, and sorting algorithms.
